# services
This repository contains docker-compose files to experiment with interesting tools & services.  
__This repo is not in use anymore since shifting to k3s instead of docker-compose. Check the ansible [k3s-install](https://github.com/Sakoes/ansible/tree/main/k3s-install) playbook for a more up-to-date view__

These services can be easily deployed by using the ansible [clean-install](https://github.com/Sakoes/ansible/tree/main/clean-install) playbook, specifically the [run-tools](https://github.com/Sakoes/ansible/blob/main/clean-install/roles/run-tools/tasks/main.yml) role
